In this Notebook, I build a predictive model that estimates the number of calories burnt during physical activity using Multiple Regression.

This analysis is valuable because it allows individuals and fitness platforms to estimate energy expenditure in real time, even when direct caloric measurement is unavailable. Understanding how different variables contribute to calorie burn — especially across genders — can improve fitness tracking, personalize workout recommendations, and enhance health analytics.
